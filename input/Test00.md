On September 5, 2024, a complaint was filed with the FBI's Cyber Crime Division regarding an alleged cyber attack targeting the financial infrastructure of State Bank of India. The attack resulted in unauthorized access to sensitive customer information, including personal identifying information (PII).

Preliminary investigations led to the identification of IP addresses linked to a group of individuals, one of whom has been identified as the primary suspect, John Doe.

Initial Complaint:
The report was filed by State Bank of India' IT security team at 10:30 AM on September 5, 2024. They reported suspicious activity on their internal network, including unauthorized access to client databases.

Evidence Collected:

Log files from State Bank of India' server showing multiple login attempts from unknown IP addresses.
Malware analysis of a trojan installed on the server, believed to be part of the attack.
Network traffic logs indicating data exfiltration attempts between September 3 and September 4, 2024.
Identification of a suspicious IP address linked to the suspect, John Doe.
Surveillance:
Physical and digital surveillance of John Doe was initiated on September 6, 2024. During this period, Doe was observed meeting with known associates involved in prior cybercrime activities.

On September 9, 2024, a federal search warrant was executed at John Doe's residence, resulting in the seizure of:

One (1) desktop computer

One (1) external hard drive containing potentially stolen data
Interrogation:
John Doe was detained for questioning on September 10, 2024. During the interview, Doe denied involvement in the cyber attack. He claimed the devices seized were for personal use only. However, digital forensics indicates the presence of tools commonly used in cybercrime activities.

Warrant Requests: Further search warrants are being requested for the suspect's financial records and communication logs to establish a possible connection to the stolen data.
